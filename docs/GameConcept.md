Title: Blackjack: A Comprehensive Game Concept

1. Introduction:
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino card game enjoyed worldwide. This comprehensive document outlines the game concept, mechanics, and design of a digital adaptation of Blackjack.

2. Game Concept:
Blackjack is a game of chance and strategy played between one or more players and a dealer. The primary objective is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. Players compete against the dealer, not each other.

3. Mechanics:
a. Deck:

A standard 52-card deck is used.
Each card has a value: numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points each, and Aces are worth 11 points.
b. Gameplay:

The player is dealt two cards face up, while the dealer receives one card face up and one face down.
Players can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher.
The round ends when the player have either busted (exceeded 21) or chosen to stand. The dealer then reveals their face-down card and draws additional cards if necessary to reach 16 or higher.
Players win if their hand beats the dealer's without going over 21 or if the dealer busts. If the player's hand ties with the dealer's, it's a tie.
c. Winning Conditions:

A player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.
A player also wins if the dealer busts (exceeds 21).
Blackjack (an Ace and a card worth 10 points) beats any other hand totaling 21 except for another Blackjack.


4. Design:
a. Interface:

The game features a user-friendly interface with options to hit, stand, displayed prominently.
Cards are displayed clearly, and the dealer's actions are automated.

b. Graphics:
Console based , text-based graphics with ASCII characters for cards and game elements.
