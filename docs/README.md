# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack game! This is a simple implementation of the popular casino card game, where the dealer stands at 17, aces are worth 11, and cannot be changed.

## Overview

Blackjack is a classic card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over. 

- Players are dealt two cards initially and have the option to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
- The dealer follows a specific set of rules, typically standing at 17 or higher. 
- Aces are worth 11 points, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are worth 10 points each.
